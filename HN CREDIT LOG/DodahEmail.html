      <p>Good morning team,</p>
      <p>Please check the expiration dates of all Dodah's products on the shelf today. This helps us get credit for expired items when the delivery arrives this afternoon.</p>
      <p>Starting today, I'll send reminders every Thursday morning. We've had issues with expired Dodah's products not being pulled on time before delivery.</p>
      <p>Let me know if you have any questions.</p>
      <p>Thank you,</p>
  </body>
